      <div>
        <time>Original Idea</time> We were given the prompt to "Create a physical robot that draws randomly"
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>
        <time>Second Project Idea</time> At this point we had done some brainstorming and we had come up with the idea to have a pysical robot that takes a picture of our users face and draws it.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>
        <time>Third Project Idea</time>Takes a picture of the User, the picture will go into p5.js. The image would be sent back up to the robot to paint the distorted picture.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>
        <time>Fourth Project Idea</time> We left the idea of the robot to work to focus on an Idea of applying filters in p5. We also thought about the filtered image to be turned into a stencil that the user could fill out.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>
        <time>Fifth Project Idea</time> We left behind the idea of the robot and descided to switch to python instead of p5. We did this for the speed of the program as well as the recourses already provided in python.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>
        <time>Sixth Project Idea</time> We found a beautification algorithm on GitHub with good documentation and easy installation with python. 
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div>
        <time>Seventh Project Idea</time> We landed on our current idea of running an image through an unreasonable amount of filters and outputting the final, as well as the steps virtually.
